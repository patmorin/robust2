\begin{abstract}
  For any constant dimension $d\ge 1$, any constant $\epsilon >0$, any
  constant $t>1$, and any $n$-point set $P\subset\R^d$, we show that there
  is a graph $G=(P,E)$ having $O(n\log^3 n\log\log n)$ edges with the following
  property:  For any $F\subseteq P$, there exists $F^+\supseteq F$, $|F^+|
  \le (1+\epsilon)|F|$ such that, for any pair $p,q\in P\setminus F^+$,
  the graph $G-F$ contains a path of length at most $t\cdot\dist(p,q)$.
  
  In the terminology of robust spanners (Bose etal 2013) the graph $G$
  is a $(1+\epsilon)k$-robust $t$-spanner of $P$. This construction is
  sparser than the most recent work (Buchin, Olah, and Har-Peled 2018)
  which proves the existence of $(1+\epsilon)k$-robust $t$-spanners with
  $n\log^{O(d)} n$ edges.

\section{Introduction}

A geometric graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V\subset\R^d$ is a (geometric)
$t$-spanner of a subset $X\subset V$ if, for every pair of vertices
$v,w\in X$, $v\neq w$,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\dist_G(vw)}{\dist(vw)} \enspace , \eqlabel{spanning-ratio}
\end{equation}
where $\dist(vw)$ denotes the Euclidean distance between $v$ and $w$ and
$\dist_G(vw)$ denote the Euclidean length of the shortest path between $v$
and $w$ in $G$, where use the convention that $\dist_G(vw)=\infty$ if $v$
and $w$ are in different components of $G$.  
Most of the research on spanners focuses on \emph{sparse}
spanners, where the number of edges in $G$ is linear, or close to linear,
in $|V|$.  In addition to having natural applications to transportation
networks, sparse $t$-spanners have found numerous applications in
approximation algorithms and geometric data structures.

For any non-decreasing function $f\colon\N\to\N$, Bose \etal\
\cite{bose.dujmovic.ea:robust} say that a geometric graph $G$ is an
\emph{$f(k)$-robust $t$-spanner} if, for every set $F\subset V(G)$,
there exists a set $F^*\supseteq F$ such that $|F^*|\le f(|F|)$ and
the graph $G-F$ is a $t$-spanner of $V(G)\setminus F^*$.  In networking
applications, this definition captures the idea that the number of nodes
harmed by a set of faulty nodes should be bounded by a function of the
number of faulty nodes.

Under this definition, the most robust spanner one could hope for
would be a $k$-robust spanner, but it is straightforward to argue
that, even for one dimensional point sets, the complete graph is the
only $k$-robust spanner.\footnote{Proof: Consider any pair of vertices
$v,w\in V$ that are not adjacent in $G$ and let $F=V\setminus\{v,w\}$.
Then $\|vw\|_{G-F}=\infty$ so $G-F$ is a not a $t$-spanner of $V\setminus
F=V\setminus F^*$ for any $t<\infty$.} The complete graph is not sparse,
and is therefore not suitable for many applications. 

A natural second-best option is a $(1+\epsilon)k$-robust spanner with
a near-linear number of edges, for some small $\epsilon >0$.  Buchin
\etal\ call these objects $\epsilon$-resilient spanners and prove the
existence of $\epsilon$-resilient spanners with $O(n\log^c n)$ edges,
where $c=O(d)$.  In the current paper we reduce the dependence on $d$
by proving the following theorem:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{main-i}
  For every constant $d\ge 1$, $\epsilon>0$, $t>1$ and every $n$-point set $P\subseteq\R^d$, there exists an $\epsilon$-resilient $t$-spanner $G=(P,E)$ with $|E|=O(n\log^3 n\log\log n)$.
\end{thm}

Bose \etal\ \cite{bose.dujmovic.ea:robust} show that, for any constants
$d\ge 1$, $\epsilon>0$ and $t\ge 1$, there exists $d$-dimensional point
sets for which any $(1+\epsilon)k$-robust $t$-spanner has $\Omega(n\log
n)$ edges.  Thus, \thmlabel{main-i} is within a factor of of $O(\log^2
n\log\log n)$ of optimal.


\section{Background}

In this section we briefly review some existing results used in
our construction.

\subsection{Expanders}

Results like the following, and its proof, are fairly standard expanders (see, for example, Hoory \etal\ \cite{hoory.linial.ea:expanders}.


\begin{lem}\lemlabel{expander-a}
   For any $k\ge 2$, $\ell\ge 2$, $n\in\N$ and any two sets $A$ and $B$
   each of size $\Theta(n)$, there exists a bipartite graph $H=(A,B,E)$
   with $|E|=O(n(k\log \ell + \ell\log k))$ such that, for any set $B'\subset B$, $|B'|\ge |B|/\ell$, $|N_H(B')| \ge (1-1/k)|A|$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
For simplicity of calculation, assume that $|A|=|B|=n$.
Fix some subset $A'\subset A$ of size $|A'|=(1-1/k)|A|$.  Let $a_1,\ldots,a_r$ be a sequence of $n$ uid random samples from $A$.
Then the probability that all of these samples a in $A'$ is 
\[
   \Pr\{\{a_1,\ldots,a_r\}\subset A'\} = (|A'|/|A|)^r = (1-1/k)^r \le e^{-r/k}
\]
Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint $n$-element sets and construct a random graph $H$ where each element in $B$ forms an edge with $\Delta$ randomly chosen (with replacement) elements in $A$.  For a fixed $A'\subset A$ with $|A'|=(1-1/k)|A|$ and a fixed $B'\subset B$ with $|B'| = n/\ell$,
\[
    \Pr\{N_H(B') \subseteq A'\} \le (1-1/k)^{\Delta n/\ell} \le e^{-\frac{\Delta n}{k\ell}}
\]
Now, the probability that there exists any such pair $(A',B')$ is at most
\begin{align*}
    \Pr\{\mathcal{E}\} 
        & \le \binom{n}{n/k}\binom{n}{n/d}e^{-\frac{\Delta n}{k\ell}} \\
        & \le (ek)^{n/k} (ed)^{n/\ell}e^{-\frac{\Delta n}{k\ell}} \\
        & = \exp((n/k)(1+\ln k) + (n/\ell)(1+\ln(\ell)) - (\Delta n)/(k\ell)) \\
        & < 1
\end{align*}
for $\Delta \ge (1+k)\log \ell + ((1+\ell)\log k$.  In particular, there must exist at least one graph that satisifies the conditions of the lemma.
\end{proof}

The following interpretation of \lemref{expander-a} will also be useful:

\begin{cor}\corlabel{expander-a}
   For any $k\ge 2$, $\ell\ge 2$, $n\in\N$ and any two sets $A$ and $B$
   each of size $\Theta(n)$, there exists a bipartite graph $H=(A,B,E)$
   with $|E|=O(n(k\log \ell + \ell\log k))$ such that
   for any $A'\subset A$ with $|A'|\le (1-1/k)|A|$, 
   \[ |\{x\in B : N_H(x)\subset A' \}| \le |B|/\ell \enspace .\]
\end{cor}




\subsection{Fair-Split Trees and Well-Separated Pair Decompositions}

For two points $p,q\in\R^d$, $\dist(p,q)$, denotes the Euclidean distance
between $p$ and $q$. For two sets $P,Q\subset\R^d$, the distance between
$P$ and $Q$ is $\dist(P,Q)=\max\{\dist(p,q):p\in P, q\in Q\}$.  For a
single point set $P\subset\R^d$, the \emph{diameter} of $P$ is denoted
by $\diam(P)=\max\{\dist(p,q):p,q\in P\}$.

For a rooted binary tree $T$, $L(T)$ denotes the set of leaves in
$T$. We use the convention that, if $T$ consists of a single node $u$,
then $L(T)=\{u\}$. The \emph{size} of $T$, denoted $|T|$ is the number of
leaves $|L(T)|$ of $T$. For a node $u$ in $T$, $T_u$ denotes the subtree
of $T$ rooted at $u$.  We say that $T$ is \emph{full} if each non-leaf
node of $T$ has exactly two children.

A \emph{fair-split tree} $T$ is a full binary tree whose
leaves are points in $\R^d$.  We let $R(T)$ denote the minimum
axis-aligned bounding box of $L(T)$ and we let $\diam'(T)$ denote the
sum of the side lengths of $R(T)$.  A fair-split tree has the following
\emph{fair-split property}: For any node $w$ with parent $x$, $\diam'(T_w)
\le (1-1/(2d))\diam'(T_x)$.\footnote{Traditionally, fair-split trees
are described as splitting $R(x)$ by bisecting its longest side.
This obviously implies that $\ell(u)\le 1-(1/2d)\ell(x)$.} It is worth
noting that $\diam(L(T))$ and $\diam'(T)$ are bounded by each other:
\[
	\diam(L(T)) \le \diam'(T) \le d\cdot\diam(L(T)) \enspace .
\]	
For any
$n$-point set $P\subset\R^d$, the fair-split tree for $P$ can be computed
in $O(dn\log n)$ time \cite{callahan.kosaraju:decomposition}.

For a finite point set $P\subset\R^d$ and any $s>0$,
\emph{well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD)} of $P$ is a set of pairs
$\{(A_i,B_i):i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}\}$ with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For every $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, 
    $\dist(A_i,B_i)\ge s\cdot\max\{\diam(A_i),\diam(B_i)\}$.
  \item For every pair $p,q\in P$ there exists exactly one
    $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ such that $p\in A_i$ and $q\in B_i$, or $q\in A_i$
    and $p\in B_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Well-separated pair decompositions were introduced by Callahan and
Kosaraju \cite{callahan.kosaraju:decomposition}, who construct them
using fair-split trees.

\begin{thm}[Callaghan and Kosaraju 1995]\thmlabel{wspd}
  For any $s\ge 1$ and any $n$-point set $P\subset\R^d$ with fair
  split tree $T=T(P)$, there exists a WSPD
  $\{(A_i,B_i):i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}\}$ of $P$ with size $m\in O(s^d n)$.
  Furthermore, each pair $(A_i,B_i)=(L(T_{a_i}),L(T_{b_i}))$ where $a_i$
  and $b_i$ are nodes of the fair-split tree $T$.
\end{thm}
We call the WSPD guaranteed by \thmref{wspd} a WSPD of $P$ \emph{using}
$T$.  In his thesis, Callaghan proves an additional useful result about
well-separated pair decompositions \cite[Lemma~4.5]{callahan:dealing}:

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{wspd-ii}[Callaghan 1995]
  In the WSPD of \thmref{wspd},
   $\sum_{i=1}^m\min\{|A_i|,|B_i|\} = O(s^d n\log n)$.
\end{lem}


\section{The Construction}

In this section we describe our construction.
\subsection{Exploding into the Root}

Let $T$ be the fair-split tree for an $n$-point set $P$ and consider
the following recursively constructed graph $G_{T}$ whose vertex set
is $P=L(T)$.  If $|T| \le \kappa$ for some constant $\kappa$, then $G_T$
is the complete graph on $L(T)$.

If $|T|>\kappa$, let $u_0$ be a node of $T$ with the property that
$|T|/3\le |T_{u_0}|\le 2|T|/3$.  The existence of $u_0$ (or rather
the edge from $u_0$ to its parent) is a standard result on binary
trees.  Let $T_1$ be the full binary tree obtained from
$T_u-T_{u_0}$ by contracting an edge incident to the unique non-leaf node
of $T_u-T_{u_0}$ that has only one child.  The graph $G_{T}$ contains
an expander $H_T=(L(T),E_T)$. This expander has parameters $d>1$,
$\alpha, \beta,\zeta,\eta > 0$ and is constructed so that it satisfies
the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(PR1)] For any $X\subset L(T_{u_0})$ with
    $|X|<(1-\beta/\Delta)|T_{u_0}|$, the number of $p\in L(T_1)$ such that
    $N_{H_T}(p)\subset X$ is most $(\alpha/\Delta)|X|$.

  \item[(PR2)] For any set $S\subset L(T_{u_0})$ with $|S|\ge
    (\zeta/\Delta)L(T_{u_0})$, $|N_{H_T}(S)|\ge (1-\eta/\Delta)|T|$.
\end{enumerate}
In our construction, $\Delta=\Theta(\log^2 n)$ and the remaining parameters
are small values that are upper bounded by some function of $\epsilon$. In particular, for any constant $\epsilon >0$, these parameters are also constant.

\begin{clm}
  For any constants $\alpha,\beta,\zeta,\eta>0$, the graph $H_T$ has
  $O(|T|\Delta\log\Delta)$ edges.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  To satisfy Property~(PR1), $H_T$ contains an expander described by
  \corref{expander-a} for the pair $(A=L(T_{u_0}),B=L(T_1)$ with parameter
  $k=\Delta/\beta$ and $\ell=\Delta/\alpha$.  This graph has $O(|T|\Delta\log\Delta)$ edges.

  To satisfy Property~(PR2), $H$ contains an expander described \lemref{expander-a} for the pair $(A=L(T_{u_0}),B=L(T))$ with parameters $k=\Delta/\eta$ and $\ell=\Delta/\zeta$. This graph also has $O(|T|\Delta\log\Delta)$ edges.
\end{proof}

Finally, we recursively construct $G_{T_{u_0}}$ and $G_{T_1}$ and add the
edges of each of the resulting graphs to $G_{T}$. This concludes the description of the graph $G_T$.

\begin{clm}
  $G_{T}$ has $O((\Delta\log\Delta)|T|\log |T|)$ edges.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  \note{PM}{Continue here with transition from $d$ to $\Delta$.}
  The graph $H_T$ has
  $O(d^2|T|)$ edges.  The recursive constructions are on two trees $T_{u_0}$
  and $T_1$ where $|T_{u_0}|+|T_1|=|T|$ and $\max\{|T_{u_0}|,T_1\}\le
  2|T|/3$. It follows that the depth of recursion is at most
  $\log_{3/2}|T|$ and each level of recursion contributes a total of
  $O(d^2|T|)$ edges for a total of $O(d^2|T|\log|T|)$ edges.
\end{proof}

Recall that $\rank(T)=\floor{\log_{3/2} |T|}$ and observe that, in
the preceding construction, $\rank(T_{u_0}) \le \rank(T)-1$ and
$\rank(T_1)\le\rank(T)-1$.  Let $F$ be an arbitrary subset of $P$.  We say
that $T$ is \emph{$F$-dense} if $|L(T)\cap F|\ge (1-\delta\rank(T)/d)|T|$
for some constant $\delta$ to be discussed shortly.  Define the set
$F^+_T$ as follows (here $u_0$ and $T_1$ are defined as above):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $T$ is $F$-dense, then $F^+_T=L(T)$.
  \item $F^+_T$ contains $F^+_{T_{u_0}}\cup F^+_{T_1}$.
  \item If $T_{u_0}$ is not $F$-dense, then $F^+_T$ contains every point $p\in L(T_1)$ such that $N_{H_T}(p)\subset F^+_{T_{u_0}}$.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{clm}
	$|F^+_T| \le (1+\epsilon\rank(T)/d)|F\cap L(T)|$.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is by induction on $\rank(T)$. If $|T|=1$, the claim is
  obvious. For $|T|\ge 2$, there are two cases to consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $T$ is $F$-dense. Then  $|L(T)\cap F|\ge
    (1-\delta\rank(T)/d)|T|$.  So
     \[
       |F^+_T|=|T|
	  \le \frac{|L(T)\cap F|}{1-\delta\rank(T)/d} 
          \le (1+\epsilon\rank(T)/d)|L(T)\cap F|
     \]
     provided that $\epsilon \ge 1/(1-\delta)-1$.

    \item $T$ is not $F$-dense. Recall that
    $\rank(T_{u_0}),\rank(T_1)\le\rank(T)-1$ so, by induction,
     \[
        |F^+_{T_{u_0}}|	+ |F^+_{T_{1}}| 
          \le (1+\epsilon\rank(T)/d)|F\cap L(T)| - (\epsilon/d)|F\cap L(T)|
     \]
     All that remains is to consider the set $F^+_{01}$ of points in 
     $L(T_1)$ added to $F^+_T$ in Step~3.  In particular, we must show that
     $|F^+_{01}|\le (\epsilon/d)|F\cap L(T)|$. If $\beta \le \delta$ then, 
     by Property~(PR1) of $H_T$,\note{PM}{($\epsilon$ should be $\delta$ in the following array)}
     \begin{align*}
      |F^+_{01}| \le (\alpha/d)|F^+_{T_{u_0}}|
        & \le (\alpha/d)(1+\epsilon\rank(T_{u_0})/d)|F\cap L(T_{u_0})| \\
        & \le (\alpha/d)(1+\epsilon\rank(T_{u_0})/d)|F\cap L(T)|\\
        & = (\alpha/d+\alpha\epsilon\rank(T_{u_0})/d^2)|F\cap L(T)| \\
        & = (\alpha/d+\alpha\epsilon/d)|F\cap L(T)| 
	     & \text{(for $d\ge \rank(T)$)} \\
	& \le (\epsilon/d)|F\cap L(T)| \enspace ,
   \end{align*}
   provided that $\alpha+\alpha\epsilon \le \epsilon$, i.e, 
   $\alpha \le 1/(1+1/\epsilon)$. Therefore, 
   $|F^+_T| = |F^+_{T_{u_0}}| + |F^+_{T_1}| + |F^+_{01}| \le (1+\epsilon\rank(T)/d)|F\cap L(T)|$, as required. \qedhere
   \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\begin{clm}
  For any $F\subset L(T)$ and every point $p\in L(T)\setminus F^+_T$,
  there exists $X\subset L(T)$, $|X|\ge (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T|-|F^+_T\cap
  L(T)|$ such that for every $q\in X$, $G_T-F$ contains a path from $p$
  to $q$ of length at most $C\diam(T)$, for $C\le 4d$.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is by induction on $|T|$.  If $|T|\le\kappa$, the result is trivial since $G_T$ is the complete graph.
  For $|T|>\kappa$, there are several cases to consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item $T_{u_1}$ is $F$-dense. In this case $F^+_T\supseteq
	  F^+_{T_{u_1}}= L(T_{u_1})$. Therefore, $p\in L(T_1)$.
          Now, we apply induction on $T_1$
       and obtain a set $X$ that is $p$-reachable with paths of length at
		  most $C\diam'(T_1)< C\diam'(T)$.  Now, 
	\begin{align*}
		|X| & \ge (1-a\rank(T_1)/d)|T_1|-|F^+_{T_1} \cap L(T_1)| \\
		& \ge (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T_1|-|F^+_{T_1} \cap L(T_1)| 
	 	& \text{(since $\rank(T)>\rank(T_1)$)} \\
		& \ge (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T_1|-|F^+_{T} \cap L(T_1)| 
		& \text{(since $F^+_T\supseteq F^+_{T_1}$)} \\
		& > (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T_1|-|F^+_{T} \cap L(T_1)| 
		  + (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T_{u_0}|-|F^+_{T_{u_0}}|
		& \text{(since $|T_{u_0}|=|F^+_{T_{u_0}}|$)} \\
		& = (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T|-|F^+_{T}\cap L(T_1)| - |F^+_{T_{u_0}}|
		& \text{(since $|T_1|+|T_{u_0}|=|T|$)} \\
		& = (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T|-|F^+_{T}\cap L(T_1)| - |F^+_T\cap L(T_{u_0})|
		& \text{(since $F^+_{T_{u_0}}=F^+_T\cap L(T_{u_0})$)} \\
		& = (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T|-|F^+_{T}| \enspace , 
	\end{align*}
	as required.
    \item $T_{u_1}$ is not $F$-dense. In this case, there are two subcases
    to consider:
    \begin{enumerate}
	    \item $p\in L(T_{u_0})$. 
		    Since $u_0$ is not the root of $T$, $\diam'(T_{u_0}) \le (1-1/2d)\diam'(T)$.  We can therefore apply induction on $T_{u_0}$ to find a $p$-reachable set $X_0\subseteq L(T_{u_0})$ of size 
\begin{align*}
	|X_0| & \ge (1-a\rank(T_{u_0})/d)|T_{u_0}|-F^+_{T_{u_0}} \\
	      & \ge (1-a\rank(T_{u_0})/d)|T_{u_0}|-(1-\epsilon\rank(T_{u_0})/d)|T_{u_0}| \\
	      & = (\epsilon-a)(\rank(T_{u_0}/d)|T_{u_0}| \\
	      & \ge (\epsilon-a)((\rank(T)-3)/d)|T_{u_0}| \\
	      & \ge ((\epsilon-a)/d)|T_{u_0}| 
		& \text{(for $|T|\ge \kappa \ge 5$)} \\
	      & \ge ((\epsilon-a)/(3d))|T| \enspace .
\end{align*}
	    By Property~PR2 of $H_T$ (with $\zeta = (\epsilon-a)/3$ and $\eta \le a\rank(T)$), we can then take $X=N_{H_T}(X_0)\setminus F^+_T$.  Then $|X| \ge (1-a\rank(T)/d)|T|-|F^+_T|$ and every point $q\in X$ is reachable from $p$ by a path of length at most
		    \[ (C(1-(1/2d))+1)\diam'(P) \le C\diam'(P) \]
	     for $C\ge 4d$.

	    \item $p\in L(T_1)$. Since $p\not\in F^+_T$, $H_T$ contains an
	    edge from $p$ to some point $p'\in L(T_{u_1})$.  As described
	    in the previous case, there is a $p'$-reachable set $X$ of
	    size $(1-a\rank(T)/d)|T|-|F^+_T|$ that is reachable from $p'$
	    by paths of length at most $((1-1/2d)C+1)\diam'(P)$.
	    The edge $pp'$ has length at most
	    $\diam'(T)$. Therefore $X$ is $p$-reachable using
	    paths of length at most $((1-1/2d)C+2)\diam'(P)
	    \le C\diam'(P)$ for $C\ge 4d$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Multiple Scales}
\seclabel{g-p}

For each node $u$ of $T$, define
$\lbl(u)=\floor{\log_{1+\epsilon}|T_u|}$. We say that a node $u$ of $T$
is \emph{special} if $u$ is a leaf or if $\lbl(u)$ is different from
both its children.  If $u$ is special, then $T_u$ is also special.  Observe that for every node $w$ of $T$, $T_w$
contains a special subtree $T_u$ with $|T_u|\ge (1-O(\epsilon))|T_w|$.
\note{PM}{Prove/check this, or redefine special appropriately if it's not
true.}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{exploder-main}
  For any constant $\epsilon' >0$, any $n\in\N$, and any $n$-point
  set $P\subset\R^d$ with fair-split tree $T$, there exists a graph
  $G_P=(P,E)$ with $O(n\log^5 n)$ edges such that, for any $F\subseteq
  P$, there exists a superset $F^+_P\supseteq F$ with $|F^+_P|\le
  (1+\epsilon')|F|$ such that for any node $w$ of $T$ and any point
  $p\in L(T_w)\setminus F^+_P$, there is a special node $u$ in $T_w$
  and a subset $X\subseteq L(T_u)$
  with $|X|\ge \epsilon'|T_u|$ such that for every $q\in X$, $G_P-F$
  contains a path from $p$ to $q$ of length at most $(C+1)\diam'(T_w)$.
\end{lem}


\begin{proof}
  Let $\epsilon >0$ be some constant that is upper bounded by some
  function of $\epsilon'$.  The graph $G_P$ contains all edges of
  $G_{T_u}$ for each special node $u$.  The parameter $d$ in the
  construction of $G_{T_u}$ is set to $d=c\log^2 n$ for some sufficiently
  large constant $c$.  Therefore, the graph $G_{T_u}$ has $O(|T_u|\log^4
  n)$ edges.  For any two special nodes, $u$ and $u'$ with $\lbl(u)=\lbl(u')$,
  the subtrees $T_u$ and $T_{u'}$ are disjoint.  This implies that the
  total number of edges in all graphs generated by nodes with label
  $i$ is $O(n\log^4 n)$.  Since there are only $O(\log n)$ different
  label values, it follows that the total number of edges in $G_P$
  is $O(n\log^5 n)$.

  We say that a node $w$ with parent $x$ in $T$ is \emph{left out of
  $u$} if $x$ is not special and the largest special subtree $T_u$
  in $T_x$ is not contained in $T_w$.  Note that each special node is
  the smaller of the two children of $x$, so that any root to leaf
  path in $T$ contains at most $\log_2 n$ left out nodes.  
	
  For a special node $u$, let $w_1,\ldots,w_k$ be the nodes left out of $u$, and  let $W_u=\bigcup_{i=1}^k L(w_i)$.  For each special node $u$ we construct
  an expander $H_u$ for the pair
  $(W_u,L(T_u))$. This expander has the property that, for any
  subset $X\subset L(T_u)$, $|X|\le (1-a)|T_u|$, the number of $p\in W_u$
  with $N_{H_u}(p)\subset X$ is at most $\epsilon|X|/\log_2 n$.
  \note{PM}{Lots of overlap here with the construction from the previous
  section. Can we unify the two?}  The graph $H_u$ has $O(|W_u|\log^2
  n)$ edges and by summing over all left out nodes $w$ these graphs have
  a total of $O(n\log^3 n)$ edges.  The graph $G_P$ contains $H_w$
  for each left out node $w$.

  This concludes the description of $G_P$
  and the analysis of the number of edges in $G_P$. What remains it is
  to describe and analyze the set $F^+_P$.

  For any subset $F\subset P$, the set $F^+_{T_u}$ is defined for every
  special node $u$ of $T$.  We define
  \[  F^*_P = \cup\{F^+_{T_u}: \text{$u$ is a special node of $T$}\}
  \]
  For each special node $u$, $|F^+_{T_u}| \le (1+O(\epsilon\log
  n/d))|F\cap L(T_u)|$.  It follows that $|F^*_P| \le (1+\epsilon)|F|$
  for a sufficiently large constant $c$.

  Next, we define the set $F^{**}_P$ as follows: For each special node $u$
  and each point $p\in W_u$, we include $p$ in $F^{**}_P$ if $N_{H_u}(w)
  \subseteq F^+_{T_u}$.  Note that, in this step, each special node $u$
  contributes at most $\epsilon |F^+_u|/\log n$ points to $F^{**}_P$
  and therefore $|F^{**}_P| \le (1+O(\epsilon))|F|$.

  Next we define 
  \[  F^{***}_P = \cup\{L(T_u) : |(F^*_P\cup F^{**}_P)\cap L(T_u)| \ge (1-\epsilon)|T_u|\} \enspace . \]
  Again, it is easily verified that $|F^{***}_P| \le (1+O(\epsilon))|F|$.

  Finally, we define $F^+_P= F^*_P\cup F^**_P\cup F^{***}_P$.   This
  concludes the definition of $F^+_P$ and the analysis of its size.
  Note that by choosing $\epsilon = \epsilon' /c$ for a sufficiently large
  constant $c$, $|F^+_P|\le (1+\epsilon')|F|$, as required by the theorem.
  All that remains is to prove that $F^+P$ satisfies the conditions of
  the theorem.  

  Now, consider any node $w$ of $T$ and any point $p\in L(T_w)\setminus F^+_P$.
  Let $u$ be a special node in $T_w$ such that $T_u$ is maximum.
  There are two cases to consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $p\in L(T_u)$. In this case, there is a subset $X\subset L(T(u))$
     such that, for each node $q\in X$, $G_{T_u}$ contains a path from
     $p$ to $q$ of length at most $C\diam(T_u)$. Furthermore,
    \begin{align*}
	    |X| & \ge (1-a/\log n)|T_u| - F^+_{T_u} \\
	        & \ge (1-a/\log n)|T_u| - (1-\epsilon)|T_u| \\
	       & \text{since $F^+_{T_u} \subset F^*_P$ and $|F^*_P\cap T_u|\le (1-\epsilon)|T_u|$} \\
		& \ge \Omega(\epsilon)|T_u| \\ 
		& \ge \Omega(\epsilon)(1-\epsilon)|T_w|  \\
		& \ge \Omega(\epsilon)|T_w| 
    \end{align*}
    as required.
    \item $p\in L(T_w)\setminus L(T_u)$.  In this case, since $p\not\in
    F^{**}_P$, $G_P-F$ contains an edge $pp'$ with $p'\in L(T_u)\setminus
    F^{+}_{T_u}$.  The edge $pp'$ has length at most $\diam(T_x)$.
    We can now proceed, as in the previous case, from $p'$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Navigating the Well-Separated Pairs}

Let $P\subset\R^d$ be an $n$-point set, let $T$ be a fair-split tree for
$P$ and let $W=\{(A_i,B_i):i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ be an $s$-well-separated
pair decomposition for $P$ using $T$. We use the convention that,
for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, $|A_i|\ge |B_i|$ and $A_i=L(T_{a_i})$
and $B_i=L(T_{b_i})$ where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are nodes of $T$.

Our robust spanner begins with the graph $G_P$ described in the previous
section that is constructed using the fair-split tree $T$.  Next,
we create a new set of well-separated pair $W'$ as follows:  For each
pair $(A_i,B_i)\in W$, we find the largest special subtree $T_{a_i'}$
of $T_{a_i}$ and the largest special subtree $T_{b_i'}$ of $T_{b_i}$
and add the pair $(A_i',B_i')=(L(T_{a_i'}),L(T_{b_i'}))$ to $W'$.
Although each pair $(A_i',B_i')\in W'$ is well-separated, $W'$ is not
necessarily a WSPD for $P$.  In particular, there are pairs of points
with $p\in A_i\setminus A_i'$, $q\in B_i\setminus B_i'$ that are not
represented in $W'$.

Next, we partition $W'$ into groups $\{W'_u: u\in V(T)\}$ indexed by
the special nodes of $T$ where, for each special node $u\in V(T)$:
\[
	W'_u = \{ (A_i',B_i')\in W' : a_i' = u \}
\]
For each group $G'_u$, define $B'_u=\bigcup\{B_i' : (L(u),B_i')\in
W'_u\}$ and let $H'_u$ be on the pair $(L(T_u), B'_u)$ with the following
properties: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(PR3)] For any $X\subseteq P$ with $|X\cap A_i|\le
  (1-\epsilon/\log n)|A_i|$, define $X'_u = \{p\in B'_u: N_{H'_u}\subseteq
  X\}$.  Then $|X'_u|\le \epsilon|X|/\log n$.

  \item[(PR4)] For any two sets $X,Y\subset A_i'$ with $|X|,|Y|\ge
  \epsilon|A_i'|$, $G$ contains at least one edge $xy$ with $x\in X$
  and $y\in Y$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $G'_P$ denote the graph obtained by taking all the edges of $H'_u$ for every special node $u$ in $T$.

\begin{clm}
  The graph $G'_P$ has $O(n\log^3 n)$ edges.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  Each expander graph $H'_u$ has $O(|T_u|\log^2 n)$.  As usual, the claim
  then follows by paritition the special nodes of $T$ into $O(\log n)$
  sets where, for any two nodes $u$ and $u'$ in the same set, $T_u$ and
  $T_{u'}$ are disjoint.
\end{proof}

Our final construction $G'_P$ contains the graph $G_P$ described in
\secref{g-p} as well $H'_u$ for every special node $u$ of $T$.

For any set $X\subset P$, we define $X'\supseteq F$ as 
$X' = \bigcup_{u\in S(T)} X'_u$.

\begin{clm}\clmlabel{f-prime-size}
  $|F'| \le O(\epsilon)|F|$.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  For each special node $u$ of $T$, $|F'_u|\le \epsilon|F\cap L(T_u)|/\log
  n$.  Again, the claim follows by paritioning the special nodes in
  $O(\log n)$ sets.
\end{proof}

Finally, the graph $G$ consists of the union of $G_P$ and $G'_P$


\begin{clm}
  For any $n$-point set $P\subset\R^d$, The graph $G'_P$  is a
  $(1+O(\epsilon))$-robust $t$-spanner of $P$.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  For any set $F\subset P$, we define $F^+ = F^+_P \cup (F^+_P)'$, where
  $F^+_P$ is defined in the proof of \lemref{exploder-main}.  That $|F^+|
  \le (1+O(\epsilon))|F|$ follows from \lemref{exploder-main}, which
  shows that $|F^+_P|\le (1+O(\epsilon))|F|$ and \clmref{f-prime-size}.

  Now, consider any two distinct points $p,q\in P\setminus F^+$ and
  $(A_i,B_i)\in W$ be the pair such that $p\in A_i$ and $q\in B_i$.
  Since $p\not\in F^+_P$, $|F^+_P\cap A_i'|\le (1-2\epsilon)|A_i'|$.
  Since $q\not\in F'$, $G-F$ Property~(PR3) of $H'_{a_i'}$ contains
  an edge $qq'$ with $q'\in A_i'\setminus F^+_P$.

  Therefore, $A_i'$ contains a set $X$ of size
  $(1-\epsilon)|A_i'|-|F^+_P\cap A_i'|\ge \epsilon|A_i'|$ such that, for
  every point $r\in X_{q'}$, $G-F$ contains a path from $p'$ to $r$ of
  length at most $C\diam'(T_{a_i'})$.  There is a similar set $Y\subseteq
  A_i'$ defined for $p$.  Property~(PR4) of $H'_{a_i'}$ therefore implies
  that there exists an edge $xy$ with $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$.

  Therefore, $G-F$ contains a path from $p$ to $q$ of length at most
  \[  \diam(A_i) + \diam(B_i) + \dist(A_i,B_i) + C\diam'(A_i) = (1+O(1/s))\dist(p,q)
  \]
  as required.
\end{proof}
