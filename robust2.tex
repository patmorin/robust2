\begin{abstract}
  For any $\epsilon >0$ and any $n\in\N$, we construct a graph $G=(V,E)$
  with vertex set $V=\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ having $O(\epsilon^{-2}n\log n)$
  edges, and such that, for any $F\subseteq V$, $G-F$ contains a monotone
  path of length at least $n-(1+\epsilon)|F|$.  The number of edges
  in $G$ matches a lower-bound of Bose \etal\ (2013) and improves the
  previous construction of Buchin, Hulshof and Ol\'ah (2018) which has
  $O(n^{1+\epsilon})$ edges and guarantees $|F^*|\le c^{1/\epsilon}|F|$,
  for some constant $c\ge 3$ and any $\epsilon >0$.

\section{Introduction}

A geometric graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V\subset\R^d$ is a (geometric)
$t$-spanner of a subset $X\subset V$ if, for every pair of vertices
$v,w\in X$, $v\neq w$,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\|vw\|_G}{\|vw\|} \enspace , \eqlabel{spanning-ratio}
\end{equation}
where $\|vw\|$ denotes the Euclidean distance between $v$ and $w$ and
$\|vw\|_G$ denote the Euclidean length of the shortest path between $v$
and $w$ in $G$, where use the convention that $\|vw\|_G=\infty$ if $v$
and $w$ are in different components of $G$.  
Most of the research on spanners focus on \emph{sparse}
spanners, where the number of edges in $G$ is linear, or close to linear,
in $|V|$.  In addition to having natural applications to transportation
networks, sparse $t$-spanners have found numerous applications in
approximation algorithms and geometric data structures.

For any non-decreasing function $f\colon\N\to\N$, Bose \etal\ say that
a geometric graph $G$ is an \emph{$f(k)$-robust $t$-spanner} if, for
every set $F\subset V(G)$, there exists a set $F^*\supseteq F$ such that
$|F^*|\le f(|F|)$ and the graph $G-F$ is a $t$-spanner of $V(G)\setminus
F^*$.  In networking applications, this definition captures the idea
that a set $F$ of faulty vertices should only have a noticeable effect
on a set $F^*$ of vertices whose size is a function of the size of $F$.

Under this definition, the most robust spanner one could hope for
would be a $k$-robust spanner, but it is straightforward to argue
that, even for one dimensional point sets, the complete graph is the
only $k$-robust spanner.\footnote{Proof: Consider any pair of vertices
$v,w\in V$ that are not adjacent in $G$ and let $F=V\setminus\{v,w\}$.
Then $\|vw\|_{G-F}=\infty$ so $G-F$ is a not a $t$-spanner of $V\setminus
F=V\setminus F^*$ for any $t<\infty$.} A natural second-best option is a
$ck$-robust spanner with a near-linear number of edges, for some $c>1$ .

Bose \etal \cite[Theorem~3]{bose.dujmovic.ea:robust} show that for any
constants $c,t>1$ and any $n$-element set $V\subset\R$, any $ck$-robust
$t$-spanner $G=(V,E)$ must have $\Omega(n\log n)$ edges.  Their work
does not give any construction matching this lower bound, leaving a
gap in our understanding of robust spanners, even in one dimension.
Buchin, Hulshof and Ol\'ah \cite{buchin.hulshof.olah:robust} made the
first progress in filling this gap by constructing, for any $\delta>0$,
a $k2^{O(1/\delta)}$-robust spanner 1-spanner having $O(n^{1+\delta})$
edges.  In the current paper, we prove the following result:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{main}
  For every $n$-element set $V\subset\R$ and every $\epsilon>0$,
  there exist a $(1+\epsilon)k$-robust 1-spanner $G=(V,E)$ with
  $O(\epsilon^{-2}n\log n)$ edges.
\end{thm}

The lower-bound discussed above implies that the number of edges
in \thmref{main} is optimal, except possibly for the dependence on
$\epsilon$.


\section{The Construction}


Without loss of generality, assume $n$ is a power of 2.  Construct a
complete ordered binary tree $T$ of height $\log_2 n$ whose nodes are
contiguous sets of integers.  The leaves of $T$, in left-to-right order,
are the singleton sets $\{0\},\ldots,\{n-1\}$ and each internal node of
$T$ is the set obtained by taking the union of its two children.  Stated
another way, $T=T(0,\log_2 n-1)$, whree $T(i,b)$ has a single node $\{i\}$
if $b=0$. Otherwise $T(i,b)$ has a root node $\{i,i+1,\ldots,i+2^{b-1}-1\}$
whose two children are the subtrees $T(i,b-1)$ and $T(i+2^{b-1}, b-1)$.

Note that the nodes of $T$ can be partitioned in levels $L_0,\ldots,L_{\log_2 n}$, where each $L_i=\{u_{i,0},\ldots,u_{i,2^i-1}\}$ and
\[
	u_{i,k} = \{kn/2^i,\ldots,(k+1)n/2^{i}-1\} \enspace .
\]
For each consecutive pair $(u_{i,k},u_{i,k+1})$ of nodes in $L_i$ we say
that $u_{i,k}$ and $u_{i,k+1}$ are \emph{buddies} and we call $u_{i,k+1}$
the \emph{right buddy} of $u_{i,k}$.  For any $k\in\{0,\ldots,2^{i}-1\}$,
we use the notation $r(u_{i,k})$ to denote the right-buddy, $u_{i,k+1}$,
of $u_{i,k}$.

\subsection{Expanders}

Our construction $G$ will consist of the union of many \emph{expander graphs} whose properties are given by the following theorem:

\begin{defn}
   A bipartite graph $B=(X,Y,E)$ with $|X|=|Y|=n$ is called
   an \emph{order-$n$ $\epsilon$-expander} for $(X,Y)$ if, for
   every $X'\subseteq X$, $|N_B(X')| \ge \min\{(1-\epsilon/2)n,
   4|X'|/\epsilon\}$.
\end{defn}

It is known that, for any $\epsilon >0$ and any $n\in\N$, there exists
an order-$n$ $\epsilon$-expander having $O(\epsilon^{-1}n\log n)$
edges \cite{X}.

Our graph $G$ will contain many $\epsilon$-expanders for pairs $(u,w)$
where $u,w\in L_i$ are nodes at the same level, $i$, of $T$.  Given a
set $F\subseteq V$, we say that a node $u$ of $T$ is \emph{sparse}
with respect to $F$ if $|u\cap F| \le (1-\epsilon)|u|$ and $u$ is
\emph{dense} (with respect to $F$) otherwise.  In other words, if $u$
is sparse then $|u\setminus F| \ge \epsilon |u|$.

The following observation is a consequence of the definitions so far:

\begin{obs}\obslabel{extend}
	Let $n$, $G$, $F$, $T$, and $L_0,\ldots,L_{\log_2 n}$ be as defined above and
  and assume the following:
  \begin{compactenum}
     \item $x\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ is a vertex and $u,w\in L_i$ 
      is a pair of nodes of $T$;
     \item $\{x\} \prec u\prec w$;
     \item $G$ contains an $\epsilon$-expander, $B_{uw}$, for $(u,w)$; and
     \item $u'\subseteq u$, $|u'|\ge\epsilon|u|/4$, and, for every $x'\in u'$, $G-F$
   contains a monotone path from $x$ to $x'$.
   \end{compactenum}
   Then there exists a
	subset $w'\subseteq w$, $|w'|\ge(1-\epsilon/2)|u|-|F\cap w|$, and, for
   every $y\in w'$, $G-F$ contains a monotone path from $x$ to $y$.
\end{obs}

\begin{proof}
  By the definition of $\epsilon$-expander definition
  $N_{B_{uw}}(u')$ is a subset of $w$ of size at least
  $(1-\epsilon/2)|w|$. Therefore  $w'=N_{B_{uw}}(u')\setminus F$ has
  size at least $(1-\epsilon/2)|w|-|F\cap w|$.  Every vertex $y$ in $w'$
  has a neighbour $x'\in u'$. Appending the edge $x'y$ to the monotone
  path from $x$ to $x'$ gives a monotone path from $x$ to $y$.
\end{proof}
   
	
\subsection{A First Try}

We now describe a first construction of $G$ that has $O(\epsilon^{-1}n\log
n)$ edges and guarantees that, for any $F\subseteq V$,  $G-F$ has a
monotone path of length at least $n-(2+O(\epsilon))|F|$.  Changing
notation slightly, this means that, for any $\delta >0$, $G$ is a
$(2+\delta)k$-robust 1-spanner with $O(\delta^{-1}n\log n)$ edges.

The graph $G$ contains, for each pair $(u,w)$ of buddies in $T$, an
expander graph $B_{uw}$ for the pair $(u,w)$.  The graph $B_{uw}$ has $O(\epsilon^{-1}|u|)$ edges. Therefore, for each level $L_i$, the buddy pairs in $L_i$ contribute $O(\epsilon^{-1} n)$ edges to $G$.  Summing over all levels we see that $G$ has $O(\epsilon^{-1}n\log n)$ edges.

Next we define a set $F^+\supseteq F$ as follows: 
\[
	F^+ = \cup\{ u\in V(T): \text{$u$ is dense or $r(u)$ is dense}\} \enspace .
\]
First we show that $F^+\supseteq F$ is not overly large:

\begin{clm}\clmlabel{size}
  $F^+\supseteq F$ and, for any $\epsilon < 1/2$, $|F^+|\le (2+4\epsilon)|F|$.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  Consider the set $M$ of \emph{maximal} dense nodes containing exactly
  those nodes $u$ of $T$ that are dense and such that no strict ancestor
  of $u$ is dense.  Observe that every $x\in F$ appears in exactly one
  node of $M$.  This immediately implies that $F^+\supseteq F$.

  To upper bound $|F^+|$, observe that $|F^+| \le \sum_{u\in M} 2|u|$
  and that 
  \[ 
     |F| = \sum_{u\in M} |F\cap u| \ge \sum_{u\in M} (1-\epsilon)|u| \enspace , 
  \]
	so
  \[
    \frac{|F^*|}{|F|} 
      \le \frac{2}{1-\epsilon} 
	= 2\sum_{r=0}^\infty\epsilon^r 
	= 2(1+\epsilon + \epsilon\sum_{r=1}^\infty \epsilon^r 
	\le 2(1+2\epsilon) \enspace . \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

Next we show that $G-F$ contains a monotone path of length $n-|F^*|$.

\begin{clm}\clmlabel{path}
  For any $F\subset V(G)$, $G-F$ contains a monotone path of length
  at least $n - (2+O(\epsilon))|F|$.
\end{clm}

\begin{proof}
  We will construct the path in $G-F$ in a sequence of phases. At
  the beginning of each phase we begin at a vertex $x\not\in F^+$
  and the phase will end when the path reaches another vertex
  $y\not\in F^+$.  Initially, we begin with $x$ as the first vertex
  not in $F^+$, i.e., $x=\min(V(G)\setminus F^+)$.

  During each phase we will always consider a pair of nodes $(a,u)$
  in $T$ where $a$ contains $x$ and $u=r(a)$.  At all times we will
  maintain a \emph{witness set} $u'\subseteq u$ of size
  \[
     |u'| \ge (1-\epsilon/2)|u|-|F\cap u|
  \]
  such that, for each $x'\in u'$, $G-F$ contains a monotone path from $x$
  to $x'$.  We call any set $u'\subseteq u$ satisfying these criteria a
  \emph{witness set} for $(x,u)$.

  When a phase begins, $a$ is the leaf of $T$ that contains only $x$ and
  therefore $u=r(a)$ is the leaf of $T$ containing only $x+1$.  Since $a$
  and $u$ are buddies, $G$ contains an expander $B_{au}$ that contains the
  single edge joining $x$ and $x+1$.  Therefore, the set $u'=u=\{x+1\}$
  is indeed a witness set for $(x,u)$.  
  At this point, if $x+1\not\in
  F^+$, then we extend our path from $x$ to $x+1$ and begin a new phase.
  Therefore, from this point on we will assume that $w\subseteq F^+$.

  Now consider the general case where $a\supset\{x\}$, $u=r(a)$ and
  $u'\subset u$ is a witness set for $(x,u)$.  Note that, since $x\not\in
  F^+$, each of $a$ and $u$ are sparse with respect to $F$. There are two cases to consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $a$ and $u$ are siblings with a common parent $\hat{a}$.  In this case, let $\hat{u}=r(\hat{a})$.  Notice that $u'\subseteq u\subset\hat{a}$ and that $|u'|\ge \epsilon|u|/2 = \epsilon|\hat{a}|/4$.  
	    Therefore, by \obsref{extend}, $\hat{u}'= N_{B_{\hat{a}\hat{u}}}(u')\setminus F$ is a witness set for $(x,\hat{u})$.
	    %Thus, we can continue this phase with $a=\hat{a}$, $u=\hat{u}$ and $u'=\hat{u}$.

    \item The parent $\hat{a}$ of $a$ and the parent $\hat{u}$ of $u$ are distinct.  In this case, $u'\subset u$ has size
    \[  |u'| \ge (1-\epsilon/2)|u|-|F\cap u| \ge \epsilon|u|/2 > \epsilon|u|/4 \enspace .\]
		  Let $w=r(u)$ be the right child of $\hat{u}$.  Then $G$ contains the expander $B_{uw}$, by \obsref{extend} $w'=N_{B_{uw}}(u')\setminus F$
		  is a witness set for $(x,w)$. 
		   Now, for every $y\in \hat{u}'=u'\cup w'$, $G-F$ contains a monotone path from $x$ to $y$ and 
		  \[ |\hat{u}'| \ge |u'|+|w'| \ge 2(1-\epsilon/2)|u| - |F\cap u| - |F\cap w| = (1-\epsilon/2)|\hat{u}| - |F\cap \hat{u}|  \enspace .
	    \]
		  Therefore $\hat{u}'$ is a witness set for $(x,\hat{u})$.
		  %and 
     %the phase can continue with $a=\hat{a}$, $u=\hat{u}$ and $u'=\hat{u}'$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Thus far, we have reached the point $\hat{u'}\subseteq \hat{u}$ is a
  witness set for $(x,\hat{u})$.  If $\hat{u}\subseteq F^+$ then we set
  $a=\hat{a}$, $u=\hat{u}$ and $u'=\hat{u}'$ and continue the phase.
  Otherwise, $\hat{u}$ contains some vertex $y\not\in F^+$.  If this
  occurs, then we complete the phase using the monotone path from $x$
  to $y$ and beging a new phase starting at $y$.

  We claim that, if a phase does not complete, the $|F\cap\hat{u}|
  \ge (1/2-\epsilon/4)|u|$.  Indeed, otherwise, 
  \[
	  |\hat{u}\setminus F^+| \ge
	  |\hat{u}|-(2+4\epsilon)|F\cap\hat{u}| \ge
	  |\hat{u}|-(2+4\epsilon)(1/2-\epsilon/4)|u|\ge
	  \epsilon/2 \enspace .
  \]
	
%	
%	
%	$\hat{u}\not\subseteq F^+$
%  and it is time to complete the phase.  
%	
%  We claim that, at this point, $w=r(u)$ is dense.  Indeed, since
%  $u\subseteq F^+$ and $u$ is sparse, the only other possibility is
%  that $u$ has some strict ancestor $\hat\hat{u}$ that is dense or has
%  a right buddy that is dense.  In Case~1 above, this is not possible
%  because every strict ancestor $\hat\hat{u}$ of $u$ contains $x$ but we
%  know that $x\not\in F^+$.  In Case~2 above, this is also not possible
%  because every strict ancestor $\hat\hat{u}$ of $u$ is an ancestor of
%  $\hat{u}$ and we know that $\hat{u}\not\subseteq F^+$.
%
%  Now, in Case~2 above, if $w$ is dense, then $w\subseteq F^+$ and
%  therefore $u\subseteq F^+$, so $\hat{u}=u\cup w\subseteq F^+$.
%  Therefore, a phase can never complete after Case~2.  Therefore,
%  the phase completes in Case~1 so the left child $w$ of $\hat{u}$
%  is dense and, since $\hat{u}$ is not dense the right child
%  $r(w)$ of $\hat{u}$ must be sparse.  By the same reasoning, the right child of $
%  
%  
%  , so $|r(w)\setminus F|>
%  \epsilon|r(w)|=\epsilon|\hat{u}|/2$.
%
%
%  To do this we take the first vertex $y=\min(\hat{u}')$ in $\hat{u}$
%  that can be reached by a monotone path from $x$.
%
%
%  Note that the monotone path from $x$ does not contain any of the
%  elements $\{z\in \hat{u}: z < y\}$.  None of these elements are in $F^+$
%  so we must take care to prove that the monotone path is, indeed, long.
%  Since we are assuming that $\hat{u}\not\subseteq F^+$, this means that
%  no ancestor of $\hat{u}$ is dense or has a right buddy that is dense.
%  On the other hand, $u\subseteq F^+$ since, otherwise, the phase would
%  have completed upon reaching $u$.  
%  
%
%  Therefore, $w=r(u)$ is dense.
%
%
%
%  Suppose that, after the completion of a round, 
%  $u\not\subset F^+$, 
%	
%	
%	then we have a monotone path from $x$ 
%	
%	satisifies our requirement
%
%
%
%
%  We being the phase at the leaf $u$ of $T$ that contains only $x$.
%  Since $x\not\in F^+$, we know that, for each ancestor $w$ of $u$, $w$
%  and $r(w)$ are both sparse.  The preceding statement is true even for
%  $w=u$, so we know that $r(u)$ is sparse.  The pair $(u,w)$ are a buddy
%  pair so $G$ contains the expander $B_{uw}$ which consists of a single
%  edge joining $x$ and $x+1$. If $w\not\subseteq F^+$, then we add the
%  edge $(x,x+1)$ to our path and the phase is complete.
%
%    Otherwise, we set $u=w$ and continue from $u$.  From this point onward,
%  $u\subset F^+$ will be a sparse node that contains a subset $u'\subset
%  u$, $|u'|\ge \epsilon|u|/2$, such that, for each $x'\in u'$, $G-F$
%  contains a monotone path from $x$ to $x'$.  
%
%  The fact that $u\subset F^+$ implies that $u$ has an ancestor $w$ such that $w$ or $r(w)$ is dense.  (This includes the case where $w=u$ and $r(u)$ is dense.)
%	
%	
%	Note that, in this case $G-F$ contains a monotone path from $x$ to every vertex in $u\setminus F$.
%
%	
%	From this we conclude that $r(u)$ is sparse.
%
%  During a phase we will have a specific node $u$ of $T$ and a subset
%	
%	for which we know thereare 
%
%
%
%  Let $v_0,\ldots,v_{\log_2 n}$ be the path from the leaf of $T$
%  containing $x$ to the root of $T$ and let $v_t$ be the last node on
%  this path that is the left child of its parent.  Observe that, for
%  each $j\in\{0,\ldots,t\}$, $v_j$ has a right neighbour $v_j'$ and,
%  since $x\not\in F^*$, $v_j'$ is sparse.
%
%  We claim that, for each $j\in\{0,\ldots,k\}$ and each node $y\in
%  v_j'\setminus F$, $G-F$ contains a monotone path from $x$ to $y$.
%  We prove this claim by induction on $j$.  For the base case, $v_0=\{x\}$
%  and $v_0'$ are buddy leaves in $T$ and there is an expander graph
%  for $(v_0,v_0')$
%  that contains the edge $xy$.
%
%  For $j>1$, the inductive hypothesis states that $G-F$ contains
%  a monotone path from $x$ to each $x'\in v_{j-1}'\setminus F$.
%  Let $S=v_{j-1}'\setminus F$.  There are two cases to consider:
%  \begin{enumerate}
%    \item $v_{j-1}$ is the left child $v_{j}$.  In this case,
%	  $S$ is a subset of $v_j$ of size at least $\epsilon|v_{j-1}|
%	  = \epsilon|v_j|/2$.  The graph $G$ contains an expander graph
%	  for the buddy pair $(v_j,v_j')$ and therefore every $y\in v_j'$
%	  contains a neighbour $x'\in S$.  The (inductive) path from
%	  $x$ to $x'$ plus the edge $x'y$ is a monotone path in $G-F$
%	  from $x$ to $y$, as required.
%
%    \item $v_{j-1}$ is the right child of $v_j$.	In this case, let
%	  $v_{j-1}''$ be the right neighbour of $v_{j-1}'$.
%	  The graph $G$ contains an expander graph for the pair
%	  $(v_{j-1}',v_{j-1}'')$ and $S$ is a subset of $v_{j-1}'$ of
%	  size at least $\epsilon|v_{j-1}'|$ so every $y\in v_{j-1}''$ is
%	  adjacent to some $x'\in v_{j-1}'$.  Therefore, for every $y\in
%	  v_{j-1}''$, there is a monotone path from $x$ to $x'$ to $y$.
%	  We finish by observing that $v_j' = v_{j-1}'\cup v_{j-1}''$.
%  \end{enumerate}
%  Finally, we observe that, for any $y\ge x$, $y$ is contained in at least one of of $v_0',\ldots,v_t'$.  Therefore $G-F$ contains a monotone path from $x$ to each $y\in\{x+1,\ldots,n\}\setminus F$, as required.
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{prop}
%  The graph $G$ defined above has $O(\epsilon^{-1}n\log n)$ edges
%  and, for any $F\subset V(G)$, $G-F$ contains a monotone path of
%  size at least $n-(2+4\epsilon)|F|$.
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{proof}
%	Let $x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_m$ be the elements of $V(G)\setminus F^*$.
%	Then, by \clmref{path}, there is a monotone path from $x_i$
%	to $x_{i+1}$, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m-1\}$.
%	The concatentation of all these paths is a monotone path of size $n-|F^*| \ge n-(2+4\epsilon)|F|$, by \clmref{size}.
%\end{proof}
%
%\section{Achieving $1+\epsilon$}
%
%
%Next, we show how to generalize our construction to obtain a set $F^*$
%of size at most $(1+\epsilon)|F|$.  To achieve this, we add additional
%expander graphs. For each $u$ of $T$, let $r(u)$ denote $u$'s right buddy.
%Our graph $G$ is parameterized by a natural number $q$.  For each
%node $u$ of $T$, and each $i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}$, $G$ contains the edges
%of an expander graph for the pair $(u,r^{(i)}(u))$.  Observe that
%this construction, with $q=1$, corresponds exactly to the graph $G$
%described in the previous section.  In this generalized construction,
%the number of edges is $O(q\epsilon^{-1} n\log n)$ edges.
%
%Given a set $F\subset V$, we define $F^*$ as follows: Each node $u$ of $T$
%is included in $F^*$ if
%\begin{enumerate}
%   \item $u$ is dense with respect to $F$; or
%   \item $r^{(i)}(u)$ exists and is dense with respect to 
%	 $F$ for all $i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}$.
%\end{enumerate}
%It follows that 
%\begin{align*} 
%	|F^*| & \le \left(\frac{1+1/q}{1-\epsilon}\right)|F| \\
%	& \le (1+1/q)(1+2\epsilon)|F| &\text{(for any $\epsilon \le 1/2$)} \\
%	& \le (1+4\epsilon)|F| &\text{(for $q=\lceil 1/\epsilon\rceil$).}
%\end{align*}
%
%All that remains is to prove that $G-F$ contains a monotone path that includes every vertex in $V\setminus F^*$.
%
%\begin{clm}
%  For any $x\in V\setminus F^*$ and any $y\in \{x+1,\ldots,n\}\setminus
%  F$, $G-F$ contains a monotone path from $x$ to $y$.
%\end{clm}
%
%\begin{proof}
%  Let $v_0,\ldots,v_{\log_2 n}$ be the path from the leaf of $T$
%  containing $x$ to the root of $T$.  Let $v_t$ be the last node on
%  this path such that at least one of $r^{(1)}(v_t),\ldots,r^{(q)}(v_t)$
%  is defined and is sparse.  Observe that every vertex $y > \max(v_t)$
%  is contained in $F^*$.
%
%  We claim that for every $j\in\{1,\ldots,t\}$ and every node $w$ such
%  that $w=r^{(i)}(v_j)$, for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}$, $G-F$ contains a
%  monotone path from $x$ to every vertex $y\in w\setminus F$.  We prove
%  this by claim by induction on $j$.  When $j=0$, $w = r^{(i)}(v_0)$
%  for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}$, so $G$ contains an expander graph for
%  the pair $(v_0,w)$ and this graph contains the single edge joining $x$
%  to the unique vertex in $y\in w$.

%  Now we wish to prove this claim for any $w\in\{r^{(i)}(v_j): i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}\}$.  First observe that, for any $i\in\{1,\ldots,\lfloor(q-1)/2\rfloor\}$, the two children of $r^{(i)}(v_j)$ are contained in 
%	$\{r^{(i)}(v_{j-1}): i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}\}$. Therefore, by induction on $j$ there is a monotone path from $x$ to every vertex of $r^{(i)}(v_j)$ for every $i\in\{1,\ldots,\lfloor (q-1)/2\rfloor\}$. From this point on we therefore assume that $w=r^{(i)}(v_j)$ for some $i \ge $ TODO: Continue here!

%
%
%  For each $j\in\{1,\ldots,t\}$, let $v_j'$ denote the first node among
%  $r^{(1)}(v_j),\ldots,r^{q}(v_j)$ that is sparse.  To prove our claim
%  for $j>1$, consider the node $v_{j-1}'$.  From the definition of $F^*$
%  (and $t$) the node $v_{j-1}'$ exists.  Let $u$ be the parent
%  of $v_{j-1}'$.
%  Below, we will argue
%  that $w=u$ or that $w=r^{(i)}(u)$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}$.
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item In the case that $w=u$, the node $u$ has two children $v_{j-1}'$
%    and $v$.  If $v_{j-1}'$ is the right child of $u$ then, by induction,
%    there is a monotone path from $x$ to every vertex in $v\setminus F$
%    and a monotone path from $x$ to every vertex in $v_{j-1}'\setminus F$
%    and we are done.  If $v_{j-1}'$ is the left child of $u$, then there
%    is a monotone path from $x$ to every vertex in $x'\in v_{j-1}'$.
%    Now, $v_{j-1}'\cap F$ is a subset of $v_{j-1}'$ of size at least
%    $\epsilon |v_{j-1}'|$ and $G$ contains an expander graph for the
%    pair $(v_{j-1}',v)$.	Therefore, for every $y\in v$ there is
%    vertex in $x'\in v_{j-1}'$ adjacent to $y$ and therefore there is
%    a monotone path from $x$ to $x'$ to $y$, as required.
%
%    \item In the case that $w=r^{(i)}(u)$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}$,
%    $v_{j-1}'\setminus F$ is a subset of $u$ of size at least
%    $\epsilon|v_{j-1}'| \ge \epsilon|u|/2$.  Now $G$ contains an expander
%    graph for the pair $(u,w)$.  Therefore every vertex $y\in w$ is
%    adjacent to some vertex $x'\in v_{j-1}'\setminus F$.  By induction there
%    is a monotone path from $x$ to $x'$ and the edge $x'y$ extends this
%    to a monotone path from $x$ to $y$, as required.
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  Thus, all that remains is to show that $w=u$ or $w=r^{(i)}(u)$ for
%  some $i\in\{1,\ldots,q\}$.  Let $\tau\in\{0,\ldots,q-1\}$ be such that
%  $v_{j-1}'=r^{(\tau+1)}(v_j)$.  From the definition of $v_{j-1}'$, we
%  know that $r^{(1)}(v_{j-1}),\ldots,r^{(\tau)}(v_{j-1})$ are all dense
%  nodes.  Any node of $T$ with 2 dense children is itself dense. Therefore
%  $r^{(1)}(v_j),\ldots,r^{(\lfloor\tau/2\rfloor)}(v_j)$ are all dense.
%  Therefore, $w=r^{(\kappa)}(v_j)$ for some $\kappa >
%  \lfloor\tau/2\rfloor$.  On the other hand, $u=r^{(\gamma)}(v_j)$ for
%  some $\gamma\in\{\lfloor\tau/2\rfloor,\lfloor\tau/2\rfloor+1\}$.
%  In either case $\kappa \ge \gamma$ so $w=u$ or
%  $w=r^{(\kappa-\gamma)}(u)$, as required.
